Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CB2) was started as an educational branch of the labs of Malay Basu and Emidio Capriotti at Universtiy of Alabama, Birmingham. The training programs under the CB2 umbrella have evolved over the years. Malay has moved to Kansas University Medical Center in April 2022. CB2EDU will soon reborn as an independent online and physical computational biology training entity. Fully independent and free, CB2EDU has lots of plan for the future. Bookmark this page.

After a one year hiatus the courses offered by CB2EDU will up again in November 2023. We currently have our flagship course [CB2101](./2023/cb2-101.html), coming up in November 2023.
