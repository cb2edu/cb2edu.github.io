    "text": "“Best course at UAB. Period.” - Anonymous student review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe name of this class is borrowed from Matthew Crawford’s book Shop Class as Soulcraft. I believe unless you achieve a level of technical expertise (shop class) it is not possible to do actual bioinformatics science (soulcraft).\n\n\n\nObjective\nCB2-101 is our flagship award-wining course. This is a very highly-rated, fast-paced, intensive and demanding, workshop-style course designed after NSF immersion learning proposal. The goal is not to make you an expert in bioinformatics, but to make you competent in carrying out bioinformatics research. The emphasis in on skills, not on theoretical expertise. The course is a registered graduate course with full 3 credits, but taught in just 12 working days. The course is designed in such a way so that the participants should be immersed in the material and dedicate full time in the duration of the course.\nAfter nearly 10 years of continuous run at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, the course is now offered in person at Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City campus. Over the years, the name of the course has evolved to reflect the content of the course. It’s better to call it by its CB2EDU call name as CB2-101.\n\n\nEligibility\nThe course is free for everyone. No programming experience necessary. However, a passion for computers and technology is essential for the course.\n\n\nDates\nNov 4-22 exept Nov 7, 8, 11. From 9:00AM to 1:00 PM every working day. The split timing is due to clash with a symposium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe course has a soft start to make sure that you come prepared for the class. Please join course Discord channel (see below) as soon as possible. All communication regarding this course will be happening through this channel.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nHEB 2223.\n\n\nWhat you need\n\nA reasonably powerful laptop with recent make; preferably 8GB RAM and 4 cores. If you have an Intel mac, contact me beforehand. We will only support x64 Windows and Linux and Apple silicon macs. If you have anything other than these you must contact me immediately.\nA github account.

For credits, you need to register officially through KUMC course registration process in addition to this from. The course is listed on catalog as “PATH 914 Bioinformatics computing”.

    "text": "This site is under development.\nComputational Biology and Bioinformatics (CB2) was started as an educational branch of the labs of Malay Basu and Emidio Capriotti at Universtiy of Alabama, Birmingham. The training programs under the CB2 umbrella have evolved over the years. Malay has moved to Kansas University Medical Center in April 2022. CB2EDU will soon reborn as an independent online and physical computational biology training entity. Fully independent and free, CB2EDU has lots of plan for the future. Bookmark this page.\nAfter a one year hiatus the courses offered by CB2EDU will up again in November 2023. We currently have our flagship course CB2-101, coming up in November 2023.\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 cb2edu.org. All rights reserved."
