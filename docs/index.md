Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CB2) was started as an educational branch of the labs of Malay Basu and Emidio Capriotti at Universtiy of Alabama, Birmingham. The training programs under the CB2 umbrella have evolved over the years. Malay has moved to Kansas University Medical Center in April 2022. CB2EDU will soon be reborn as an independent online and in-person computational biology traning entity. Fully independent and free, CB2EDU has lots of plan for the future. Bookmark this page.
