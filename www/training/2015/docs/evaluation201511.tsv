Maybe in the future spend more time on panda.dataframes?  Regardless, this was the most useful course that I attended while at UAB-even though I did not take it for credit. For that, thank you.

The instructor couldn't look at our screens, and so it made it hard to describe problems. A lot of times you could tell that people were sitting in confusion and not saying anything, until one person finally decided to ask a question and then others would nod in agreement.  Overall the course was incredibly difficult - not enough time was spent on basic understanding of Python, especially. I still don't understand basic things and I don't think that the logic of programs was extensively covered in class. We had bits and pieces of info in the handouts but it didn't seem like enough to build a program that would run. I can Google things all day but in the end a lot of the websites still confuse me more than help due to the language used.   I'm glad that I had exposure to Linux and programming, but I don't think that I can do anything useful with it at this point or even understand the tutorials online. To improve I'd say go more slowly for the Python and R stuff, and really explain every little detail - i.e., why every single line was added or written the way it was written.
